Consensus is a top place to work due to the incredible culture our employees have created. In fact, RepVue has ranked us #1 in their top 20 ""Best Culture and Leadership"" category. We strive to provide an opportunity to work with a great team with a compelling product with the objective that adding value in your work life fuels the rest of your life. We know that a winning company is built on the efforts of its people, and that’s an environment we foster at Consensus. We encourage every employee to bring their authentic self to work and take ownership of their position and their career. We strive to give our employees everything they need to make meaningful contributions to the overall success of our company. We’re looking for go-getters that are excited to thrive in a company going through an exciting growth phase!

We are a fast-growing SaaS company based in the United States. We are changing the way the world buys enterprise software. We do this by providing intelligent demo automation software that helps you scale Presales. How does this work?

We believe buying enterprise software should be simple, pleasant, and fast instead of complex, painful, and slow (which is how it is today). Buyers now want instant access to presales (sales engineering) resources throughout the buying experience but they find it harder and harder to get what they need. Using Consensus, a sales engineering team builds a library of reusable interactive video demos that Sales sends out on-demand. Consensus automatically personalizes the experience and tracks engagement as the prospect shares the demo with other stakeholders in the buying group, bringing the entire buying group to live demos better educated and ready to talk specifics.

This not only reduces unqualified demos to near zero and can double the presales team’s productivity, it also removes the ""demo lag time"" for prospects and shortens the sales cycle by as much as 68%.

Our Values: 

Our values are extremely important to us and we hope that they mean something to you too. We want everyone to bring their authentic selves to work every day. We hope you can help us continue to grow without having to be perfect, but willing to put your name on something knowing it is a “version one”. Everyone here takes total ownership and accountability, because owning our outcomes means making a real contribution. We also believe in a “no peacemongering” principle. We know our path to success is hard and we don’t hesitate to ask hard things of others. We are respectfully confrontational to one another and ask direct accountability questions.

Job Description  You don’t see it, but it’s there. Our employees work on the world’s most advanced electronics – from saving emissions in the City of Lights to powering the Mars Rover to protecting the F- 35 fighter jet. At Electronic Systems, you’ll be among the brightest minds, working on the aerospace and defense industry’s most difficult problems. Drawing strength from our differences, we’re innovating for the future. And you can, too. Our flexible work environment provides you a chance to change the world without giving up your personal life. We put our customers first – exemplified by our missions: “We Protect Those Who Protect Us®” and “We Innovate For Those Who Move The WorldTM.” Sound like a team you want to be a part of? Come build your career with BAE Systems.

Our Operations employees turn innovative engineering designs into real solutions to meet our customers’ needs. From Supply Chain, to manufacturing and test, Electronic Systems offers opportunities to work with technology rarely accessible in other manufacturing firms. Our training and development programs provide employees with career advancement in a diverse work environment.

Because of the need for consistent, in-person collaboration and/or the requirement to perform all work onsite due to the nature of this particular role, it will be performed full-time on site. This means work will be conducted on location at a BAE Systems facility 100% of the time.

In this role, you will be joining a team supporting internal customers, designing, implementing and managing lab infrastructure to meet the customer requirements. In this role, you will build, configure, administer and troubleshoot Windows (and Linux) servers and user workstation hardware and software; design and implement workgroup-scale networks; build and manage authentication, file-share, and other collaboration servers to support groups of heterogeneous client systems. You will work with facilities security staff to develop and apply hardening steps for systems for classified use to NISPOM Chapter 8, JAFAN, and other customer standards. Document system configuration for new and existing systems. Experience with centralized authentication technologies such as LDAP and Active Directory domains in supporting (Windows/Linux) cross-platform clients is desirable.

You should be customer service oriented, attentive to detail, self-motivated and work well in teams. Flexibility in approach to finding solutions, the ability to understand and act on the customer needs and priorities, and learn new technologies quickly are some of the qualities a successful candidate will have. You should have experience in enterprise level Windows Server operating environments, including Windows Active Directory, Group Policy Management, SharePoint, Exchange services. Additionally, experience with TCP/IP and Microsoft Networking concepts would also be required, as well as Windows and Unix/Linux interoperability services (e.g. centralized authentication technologies for cross-platform clients) and Windows shell scripting.

This role will require occasional off-hours responses to outages and an individual to take part in subsequent service restoration efforts.

Active Secret clearance.

CompTIA Security+ (or equivalent) may be required to work in some of the customer labs, and preference will be given to candidates who hold this certificate.

Additionally, experience with TCP/IP and Microsoft Networking concepts would also be required, as well as Windows and Unix/Linux interoperability services (e.g. centralized authentication technologies for cross-platform clients) and Windows shell scripting.
